        <p>This is my basic paragraph about myself. I am learning how to code and preparing myself to get a job in the future in web development.
    I have been teaching myself online since the beginning of the year and decided to put myself in a better position to succeed by attending a full stack developer bootcamp.
    So far I have explored HTML, HTML5, CSS, and a little bit of JS. I can't wait to see what the future holds for myself!</p>

    <p>Other than that I live in Tremont, Ohio with my long term boyfriend and our dog. We have been on the west side for 8 years. It truly is the best side. I love being in Cleveland and can't wait to see it continue to grow! Hopefully I can be a small part of that.</p>
